A visitor logs onto the website and discovers a comprehensive inventory of upcoming events, complete with names, dates, times, venues, and event details. Each event in the list is accompanied by a "remove" button. The user selects this button for one of the events, resulting in its removal from the list. Additionally, there's a form that enables the user to input details for a new event they'd like to plan. Upon completing the form and submitting it, the user sees their event included in the list of upcoming parties.
